# Advanced-Signature-Recognition-System-using-Few-Shot-Learning-and-Siamese-Networks


## Project Description

This project implements a **Siamese Network** for signature verification, leveraging **few-shot learning** to perform effective feature extraction and signature matching with minimal training images per class. The network learns to compare signature pairs and determine whether they belong to the same individual. A **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier** is used to enhance signature classification accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Few-shot learning**: Efficient signature classification with limited data.
- **Siamese Network**: Learns feature embeddings for signature similarity comparison.
- **KNN Classifier**: Uses learned feature representations for final classification.
- **Automated dataset setup**: Automatically downloads dataset if not available.

## About the Dataset

The dataset consists of **signature images** grouped into different classes. Each class represents signatures from a single individual. The model is trained on signature pairs to learn similarities and differences. The dataset follows the structure:

```
Dataset/
├── class1/
│   ├── signature1.png
│   ├── signature2.png
│   └── ...
├── class2/
│   ├── signature1.png
│   ├── signature2.png
│   └── ...
```

If the dataset is not available, the script will automatically download it.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure **Python 3.10** is installed and dependencies are available.

Run the following commands:
```sh
# Check if pip is installed
pip --version

# Upgrade pip (if needed)
python3.10 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up the Dataset
Ensure the dataset is structured as mentioned. If not available, it will be automatically downloaded.

### 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Execute the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the Siamese Network.

## Model Architecture: Siamese Network

### What is Signature Verification?
Signature verification is a **biometric authentication technique** that determines whether a given signature matches a known reference signature.

### How Does the Siamese Network Work?
A **Siamese Network** consists of two identical sub-networks that learn feature representations from input images. Given two signature images, the network computes their embeddings and measures similarity.

#### Steps:
1. Two signature images are passed through **identical CNN feature extractors**.
2. The output embeddings are compared using a **distance metric** (e.g., Euclidean distance).
3. If the distance is below a threshold, the signatures are classified as a match; otherwise, they are considered different.

### Key Components:
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Extracts signature features.
- **Contrastive Loss Function**: Optimizes embedding distance for similarity learning.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Uses extracted features for final classification.

## Loss Functions

### 1. **Contrastive Loss**
Encourages similar signatures to have closer embeddings while pushing different ones apart.

### 2. **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**
Used when treating signature verification as a binary classification problem (match vs. non-match).

---
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Siamese Networks can be effectively used for **signature verification** with few-shot learning. The model learns to recognize signature similarities with minimal labeled data, making it useful for real-world authentication systems.

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with **Triplet Loss** for improved similarity learning.
- Fine-tuning with a larger dataset for better generalization.
- Implementing real-time signature verification using a deployed model.
